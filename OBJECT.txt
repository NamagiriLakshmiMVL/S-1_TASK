2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
  
  OBJECTS: Objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the 	   form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively,	   in the context of an object.

           Object is a  Collection of Properties in Javascript.
  
           Property is an association between the Key and the value.

           If a Property value is a function then it is called as Methods.

           Object can be created using Object-Initializer.

           Objects are enclosed within Curly-braces {}.

           this keyword is used to refer objects in Javascript.

   Syntax: const object = 
           {
           property1: value1, 
           property2: value2, 
           "property n": value3, 
           };
  
   Example: const car = { name:"Duster" , color:"Brown" , model:"500" }

            car is an object enclosed within Curly braces.name value pairs are seperated by colon.



INTERNAL REPRESENTATION OF OBJECTS IN JAVASCRIPT

Addition of Properties: Syntax:
                          ObjectName.ObjectProperty = propertyValue;
                        
                        Both Object name and property name are case sensitive.Using dot operator(.) can access the property of the               
                        object.

			Example:
                          const Car = new Object()
                          Car.name = "BMW";
                          Car.color = "Black";

Deletion of Properties: Syntax:
                          delete ObjectName.ObjectProperty;

                        Example:
                          delete Car.name;

Accessing the Properties: Syntax: 
                            objectName.property        
          
                            objectName["property”]     
           
                          Example:
                             Car.color;
                             Car["color"]

Object Methods :  It is also an object Property but contains a function defenition within it.
                   
                  Syntax:
                    function()
                    {
                       return property.value  
                    }

                   Example:
                    function()
                    {
                       return car.color
                    }

Creating With Constructors: It is created by the keyword 'new'.
                             
                            Example:
                             function Vehicle(name, maker) {
                             this.name = name;
                             this.maker = maker;
                             }
			     let car1 = new Vehicle(’Fiesta’, 'Ford’);
                             let car2 = new Vehicle(’Santa Fe’, 'Hyundai’)
                             console.log(car1.name);    
                             console.log(car2.name);
